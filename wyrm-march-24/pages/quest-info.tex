The beasts of the menagerie grow hungry and bored... 

On your way in, you should have been assigned to one of the following teams: \emph{Team Red}, \emph{Team Magic Horse}, or \emph{Team Cerberus}. If you have not been allocated a team (and want to be. Why wouldn't you though), then please go back to the desk you obtained this handbook from and kindly berate the receptionists until they give you one.

On the next page, you will discover a list of potentially dangerous, maybe evil, and definitely surprising items. Find any of these things, bring evidence to the front desk and win fabulous prizes... such as points for your team (and uh...nothing else...)! Whoever earns the most points gets to go home proud knowing they managed to satisfy their glorious mascots (and not in their stomachs).

Enjoy scavenging, and remember --- the menagerie does not like waiting...

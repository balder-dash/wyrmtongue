Greetings, and on behalf of Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, welcome to \textbf{Picocon 41: The Menagerie}!

First and foremost, I would like to thank our dedicated Picocon Sofa and Beanbag, Riyah and Kai, who have done an incredible job organising and running our 41st Picocon. With her knowledge from being Beanbag last year, Riyah has done a spectacular job spearheading the organisation of Picocon, with the assistance of Kai, who was elected to their position in November.

I’d also like to thank the rest of ICSF Committee for their efforts and dedication in bringing Picocon 41 to life. As a first-time member of  the committee, I’ve had an incredible time getting to know everyone this year, and helping keep the society running, and I’m so grateful for the dedication and enthusiasm of our members, without whom events like Picocon wouldn't be possible.

And finally, thank you for coming and being a part of our Picocon community! Your presence and enthusiasm makes all the difference, and without you, we wouldn’t be able to make Picocon happen. We’re thrilled to have you join us for this celebration of science fiction and fantasy!

Now, let's dive into the fantastical world of Picocon 41: The Menagerie! Embrace the adventure, the creativity, and the camaraderie that make our community so special.

Enjoy!

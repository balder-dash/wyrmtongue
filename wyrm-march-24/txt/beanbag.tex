Menagerie --- an umbrella term for all the wonderful and horrifying creatures trapped between the pages of fiction. Who knows why we, in turn, are ensnared by these fantastical beasts? Between univeristy and organising this convention, this has been a hectic term, but I had so much fun inviting our incredible speakers this year, and wrangling the rest of the committee for our many preparations, which I hope you will enjoy.

Have a wonderful day :$)$

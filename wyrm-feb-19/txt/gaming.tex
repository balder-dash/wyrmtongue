Imperial College Gaming is not officially affiliated with ICSF, but
the Venn diagram has practically been a circle for the past couple of
years. So we're back this Picocon to provide another set of
distractions!

Our consoles will be set up in Blackett 1004 from 4pm into the
evening, running some of our most popular games. Whether you’re a
hardcore gamer or just fancy something a bit different to do, drop in
to the session and I'm sure you’ll have a lot of fun \textemdash{}
there’s a good reason why video games are one of the leading causes of
procrastination in the country.

For any Imperial students who have just realised how much they’ve been
missing gaming from their lives, the Gaming Club meets regularly on
Wednesdays from 2pm, with details distributed on the mailing list.

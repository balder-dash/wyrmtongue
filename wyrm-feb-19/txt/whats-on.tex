To returning guests and Picocon first-timers alike: welcome! Here's a
summary of what lies in your exciting day ahead:

Throughout the day will be talks from our illustrious \emph{Guests of
Honour}, as well as a Guest Panel followed by book signings.

The afternoon begins with the \emph{Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise
(DoDM)}, in which bidders contend for the right to rescue misguided
pieces of merchandise from terrible death \textemdash{} or to
personally exact their destruction by way of liquid nitrogen and
giant hammer. All proceeds go to charity, in collaboration with RAG.

Join us during \emph{Silly Games} and experience amusement and general
 hilarity. We aren't sure why you would want to subject yourself to
 the horror of the \emph{Turkey Readings}, but uh, that's a thing
 that's happening, too. There is an event later in the evening and it
 is known as \emph{Harmless Fun}, which does not at all sound vaguely
 ominous.

\emph{Imperial Tabletop \& Gaming} return this year with entertaining
diversions \textemdash{} find them in Blackett 1004. Alternatively,
search vendor stands in the Blackett Foyer for books and other things,
or visit the cosy \emph{Sci-Fi Library}, open throughout the day in
Beit's West Basement.

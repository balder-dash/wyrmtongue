Welcome Guests!

So, itâ€™s that time of the year again. Picocon is here, hurray! The
initial pitch I was given for this convention was \emph{Picocon On
  Fire}, however I put my foot down and now we have the marvellous
\emph{Picocon Intrigue} instead \textemdash{} A decision that I'm sure
won't result in my deposition later today. My sincerest thanks to our
Sofa and his Beanbag minion, Ed and Harry, for all their work: I've
been assured that this'll be the best and least on-fire convention
we've run in recent years. We have some fantastic guests lined up for
you, a stash of the world's worst merchandise just asking to be dipped
in liquid nitrogen and smashed with an oversized hammer, no fish
anywhere, and I've been told there's a statue being erected in my
honour.

It's been a good year for the society, and certainly one with less
water than last year. We started using more social media platforms and
had a large number of successful events. You'll no doubt see me around
chaperoning Andrew Bannister, so feel free to approach me if you have
any questions/complaints/urgent philosophical quandaries. Other than
that, relax, take in the talks, play some games, smash tat, and have a
great day!

On your way in, you should have been assigned to one of three
teams \textemdash{} \emph{Detective Pikachu}, \emph{Commander Riker},
or \emph{Cthulhu} \textemdash{} and given a sticky badge to
wear with newfound pride. If somehow you slipped through the net, or
misplaced your badge, then go and politely berate the receptionists
until they give you one.

On the next page, you will find a list of dangerous, potentially
impossible items. Find any of these items, bring the evidence back to
the front desk, and win fabulous prizes \ldots in the form of points
for your team. Whichever team ends up with the most points will be
declared the finest, the greatest, and most importantly, the winners!

Now go \emph{for great justice.}

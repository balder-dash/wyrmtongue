{Roz Kaveney} in her own words: I'm a bit older than most people in the
fandom\textemdash I just turned 52. I have a long and complicated
personal history which I am in the process of turning into a huge
memoir; crucial facts are that I was reared Catholic but got over it,
was born male but got over it, stopped sleeping with boys about the
time I stopped being one and am much happier than I was when I was
younger.

A UK resident who has lived in the US a bit, I have a certain
distinction in the SF field as a critic, have at various points been
seriously involved in civil liberties and anti-censorship politics and
write for various reasonably reputable newspapers and periodicals.

I like moonlighting as a committed fan: I never had that much serious
credibility to lose, and haven't lost what I had anyway. I spend too
much time listening to an unholy mixture of Bach, Shostakovich,
Springsteen, Patti Smith, Ella Fitzgerald and Lotte Lenya.

{Juliet Kemp} is a queer, non-binary writer. They live in London by
the river, with their partners, kid, and dog. Their recent works
include the fantasy novel \textit{The Deep And Shining Dark} (featured
on the Locus 2018 Recommended Reads list, under `first novel') and the
YA SF novella \textit{A Glimmer Of Silver.}  When not writing,
child-wrangling, or dog-wrangling, Juliet knits, indulges their
fountain pen habit, and goes bouldering.

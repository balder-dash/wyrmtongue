Hello everyone, and welcome to the 37th Annual Picocon!

You are in for a wonderful day full of talks, panels, Silly Games,
merchandise smashing and fictitious fish fighting. Our Picocon Sofa
and Beanbag have been hard at work all year round, aided by many
volunteers, to bring this wonderful convention to life and we all hope
you enjoy every second of it. Look to the Sofa's editorial to find out
more about the day.

I am pleased to report that, thanks to the continued efforts of a
wonderful community and hardworking committee, the library remains a
den of escapism and nerdiness. Highlights of this year so far have
included hazardously joyful events such as our Christmas and Halloween
parties, weekly Doctor Who viewings and the odd mafia takeover. We
continue our expansion into the fields of membership (More people!),
the Dyson library (More books!) and IC Radio (Our podcast every
Wednesday from 3PM!). Do pop down to the library itself if you'd like a
quick visit over the course of the day.

We have plenty more planned for the rest of the year, but for now I
shall wish you all a happy and entertaining Picocon!

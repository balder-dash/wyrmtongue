\textit{Best in Galaxy} started as a comedy sci-fi parody podcast in 2016,
which morphed from a Star Wars parody into its own universe. It won a
Parsec Award for Best Comedy in 2017 and gained a cult following,
becoming a novel and audiobook in late 2019. Writer and co-creator
Mark Restuccia is here today with paperback copies and info about the
podcast and the \textit{Best in Galaxy} universe.

To returning guests and first-timers alike: welcome! Here's a look
forward in time into your day ahead at Picocon.

Throughout the day there will be talks from our illustrious
\textbf{Guests of Honour}, as well as a panel discussion \textemdash{}
chaired this year by the brilliant \textbf{Yasmin Benoit} \textemdash{}
followed by book signings.

Meanwhile, other exciting activities are happening across the
campus:

\vfill
\activity{Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise}{Queen's Lawn 16:00 -- 16:30}{dodm}
\activity{Tabletop \& Gaming}{Blackett 1004 16:00 onwards}{gaming}
\activity{Sci-Fi Library}{Beit West Basement}{library}
\vfill

Absent from this list, as you might have noticed, is a fish duel. This
is because a fish duel is not something that happens at Picocon.

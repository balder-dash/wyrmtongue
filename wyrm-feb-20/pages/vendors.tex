\subhead{Paul Couper}
A reader/collector of SF/Fantasy, selling at Picocon to
clear duplicates built up whilst collecting and upgrading. My
collection is now over 12,000 paperbacks, but still has many gaps: if
anyone has collectables for sale, or wants to buy, or indeed just
wants achat, stop by during the day.

\subhead{Clockwork Firebird Designs}
I am a self-taught, ever-evolving tailor, leather worker and costume
maker with a penchant for creating monsters. I attend Live Action
Role-Play (LARP) events and Anime/Comic conventions as both a trader
and attendee on a regular basis. I’ve been doing leather work since
2008, and selling since 2011. I recall learning to sew when I was 6
years old and I’ve not really stopped since. Within the shop you may
find armour, masks, trinkets, painted artworks, soft toys
\textellipsis anything I bring to mind or feel like turning my hand
to! I am still finding my feet, and I am always learning new
techniques.

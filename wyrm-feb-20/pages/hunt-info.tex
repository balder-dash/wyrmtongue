On your way in, you should have been assigned to one of three
teams\textemdash \emph{Jughead}, \emph{Captain Jack Harkness}, or
\emph{Sulu}\textemdash and given a sticky badge to wear with newfound
pride. If somehow you slipped through the net, or misplaced your
badge, then go and politely berate the receptionists until they give
you one.

On the next page, you will find a list of dangerous, potentially
impossible items. Find any of these items, bring the evidence back to
the front desk, and win fabulous prizes\textemdash in the form of
points for your team. Whichever team ends up with the most points will
be declared the finest, the greatest, and most importantly, the
\emph{winners!}

Now go \emph{for great justice.}

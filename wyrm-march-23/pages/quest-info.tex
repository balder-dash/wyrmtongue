In a twist of fate (get it?\footnotemark[1]), you have been assigned to one of the following teams: \emph{The Cyclones}, \emph{The Fractals}, or \emph{The Helix People}. If you have not been allocated a team (and want to be (why wouldn't you though (we're all nice people here))), then please go back to the desk you obtained this magazine from and kindly berate the receptionists until they give you one.

On the next page, you will discover a list of potentially dangerous, maybe evil, and definitely surprising items and/or subversive concepts. Find any of these items, bring evidence to the front desk and win fabulous prizes... such as points for your team (and uh...nothing else...\footnotemark[2])! Whoever earns the most points gets to go home proud knowing they managed to spot as many convoluted concepts this committee managed to squeeze from our brains.

Enjoy scavenging, for good fun and tumultuous delight :)

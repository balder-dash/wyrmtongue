Twisted is a celebration of the subversive nature of tales spun by storytellers, through the loom of words, screen and anything in between. It’s been a whirlwind to organise, but I enjoyed every convoluted minute of it and hope you do too. Between the GoH’s twisty talks and a variety of loopy games and activities, you’re sure to be entertained.

During the day, you might find yourself meandering on the curling complexities of life, from nautili to black holes. But be careful \textendash{} if you spiral too hard, you might become aware of something more, coiling around the reality you know and waiting patiently with twisted intent for you to slip up. I’m afraid it may already be too late.

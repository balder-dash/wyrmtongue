To both returning guests and the curious souls who have wandered into their very first Picocon... Welcome! By chance or fate, here's a quick summary for your exciting day ahead:

Throughout the day, we will be graced with the presence of several fantastic \emph{Guests of Honour}, who will be giving us talks on various twisty tangents, as well as a \emph{Guest Panel} followed by book signings. Be sure to pop in whenever you want!

In the afternoon, we continue with the \emph{Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise (DDoM)}, where audience members can join a bidding war for the right to rescue misguided pieces of, you guessed it, dodgy merchandise. Or one could personally exact their destruction with nothing but liquid nitrogen and a merciful hammer. All proceeds go to charity. Additionally, there will be an event later in the afternoon involving long sticks of french bread.

Following tradition, we will also be having \emph{Turkey Talks}, a twisted form of self-inflicted torture where some masochists go up to speak on stage, and the audience can keep them talking by way of donations which also go to charity. 

\emph{Imperial Tabletop \& Gaming} returns once more in \emph{Femtocon}! Many thanks to those who are running it and definitely check out their society as well. And of course, kindred spirits are always welcome to visit the \emph{Sci-Fi Library}, open lunchtimes throughout the week in Beit's West Basement.

That's all from me. Enjoy the convention!

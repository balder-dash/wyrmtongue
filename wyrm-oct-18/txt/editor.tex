\lettrine[lines=3]{H}{ello} there. Thank you for picking up this issue of \textit{Wyrmtongue}, the newsletter brought to you by ICSF, the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. May this be a fine addition to the avalanche of small stacks of paper and other miscellaneous Freshers' Fair handouts. This issue of \textit{Wyrmtongue} contains society news, as well as information about the many exciting things happening this term and throughout the rest of the year.

In addition to this newsletter, the aspiring artists and writers among you might also like to know about our (usually) annual fanzine: a society publication with over 40 years of mythical history, containing anything from short stories, artwork, and poetry, to reviews and essays on topics related to speculative fiction. Contributions to the fanzine are always welcome; send a message to \url{icsfwyrmtongue@gmail.com}, or subscribe to our mailing lists to receive updates about an artwork contest later in the year \textemdash{} or do both of those things! Both is good.

Turn the page and read on to find out more about our lovely subterranean lair in Beit's west basement, about Book Crawls and cinema outings, about a radio show, and about a convention happening this February right here at Imperial College.

Here's to a(nother) splendid year at Imperial. See you in the library!

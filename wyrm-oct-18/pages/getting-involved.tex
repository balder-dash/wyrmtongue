\pagesubhead{Mailing Lists}%
ICSF maintains two mailing lists, to which all members are welcome to subscribe:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{icsf-list} is the society’s core mailing list, which communicates announcements of ICSF events and important news about the society. This list does not generate an overwhelming amount of traffic, and \textit{is a must if you would like to hear about film trips and other activities.}

\item \texttt{icsf-committee} is our ‘management’ list \textemdash{} but it gets used a lot more widely than that. Here you’ll be able to contribute your opinion to the running of the society.
\end{itemize}

You can manage your subscriptions at \url{mailman.imperial.ac.uk/mailman}.

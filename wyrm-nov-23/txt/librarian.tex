Hi everyone! I'm Hetty and I'll be your Head Librarian for this year. Did you know that our library holds over 10,000 books and 600 graphic novels? Not to mention our massive DVD collection! As a society we are proud of our library content, and I'm pleased to be your go-to person for any book borrowing or library-related queries for this year.

A bit about our library. We are located in the West Basement of Beit Quad. If you haven't been there before it might be a little tricky to locate - if you can't find it give us a shout! The door needs to be unlocked by a card with special access, so that's why one of our committee members are down there every lunchtime between 12 and 2pm to keep the library open. If you ever want to borrow books, or simply hang out in a nice space (might I mention with beanbags and a TV), come along during those hours. The library is also open when we have events (e.g. movie/game nights etc.), which are normally weekly on Friday evenings. We post all our events on our Instagram (\href{https://www.instagram.com/imperial_scifi/?hl=en}{@imperial\_scifi}) so make sure to follow us there!

I hope you enjoy our library and make use of our grand collection. Additionally, if you have suggestions for even more library content do let us know as we have grant money which needs spending :)). Have a superb year, and GET READING!

It's 2023. Your coursework's overwhelming. You take a stroll on campus and find a mysterious QR code lying on the ground. You scan it -- lo and behold! -- some pixels appear on your screen! Here's what those pixels say:

\textit{Wyrmtongue}. That is the name of this newsletter, brought to you by the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. This issue contains society news, some book recommendations that \textit{may} fall under one of two specific genres, and some information about an inconspicuous convention happening sometime in March...

In addition to this newsletter, the aspiring artists and writers among you might also like to know about our annual fanzine -- we take short stories, artwork, poetry and the \textbf{rare} fanfic (send us a HP fanfic and you will be hunted for sport\footnotemark[2]{}). This year's theme will be revealed in the Picocon section. Contributions to the fanzine are always welcome; feel free to send a message to \texttt{icsfwyrmtongue@gmail.com}. Submissions will be open from the start of Spring term till the end of February.

Read on to find out more about our society, some future events and our collection in Beit's west basement. Have a great year, and if fate wills it, see you in the library!

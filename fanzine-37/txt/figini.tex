Oh the fun of being young.
The freedom you’d have
Able to play when you wanted
Having naps when you wanted
Looking up at the adults thinking
I want to be like,
But not yet!


Oh the fun of being a kid
Making new friends, 
going to their houses
Watching movies by yourself
Sitting at the adult table
Feeling more included


Oh the fun of being a teenager
Trying new things
Meeting new people
Falling in love
With whom ever you wanted
Having more freedom than a kid
But not all the time!


Oh the fun of being an adult
Surviving on your own
No more parents in the next room
Going out with your mates
But only when time allowed


Oh the fun of being yourself
There’s nothing that compares
All your experiences
All your feelings
All yours 
And no one can take them away
Because you are who you are
Oh the fun of being you

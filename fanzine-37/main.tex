\head{From the Editor}

Where an old tree once stood, a girl remembers; far away, a
quarter-hundred diplomats sit in a circle. In a tale with many
endings, in none of them do heroes save the universe; aboard a
spacecraft far above a sky made of dust, a robot tells their captain a
story from a dead planet.

These are the wondrous visions brought to you by the writers and
artists of this issue of the \textit{Picocon Fanzine:} the companion
publication to the annual convention, and a showcase of creative work
from the Imperial College Science Fiction \& Fantasy Society. We hope
you enjoy the stories.

As always: our sincere thanks to all of you who wrote to us in these
past few months. To those of you with us today at Picocon 37
\textit{Pride,} have a great time! And to those of you reading in the
future\textemdash we hope it is good. \tombstone{}

ICSF isn't the only go to society for fantasy at Imperial.
Femtocon --- named for being smaller than our main convention Picocon ---
is the introductory event of our sister society Tabletop Gaming, which will
be taking place in the Union.

On offer will be a variety of board games, table-top RPGs, card games
and wargaming - along with a great opportunity to meet members of both
societies.

In conjunction with this, this library will be open for most of the day, as a
rest stop offering a range of less interactive distractions.

Femtocon will be on \textbf{Wednesday 15th October}.

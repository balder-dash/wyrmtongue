Hi everybody! Thanks for picking up this issue of Wyrmtongue, the newsletter for the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy society (ICSF). Here you can find out about the society, and what will be going on this term and throughout the year. As ICSF editor, I'll also be putting together fanzines featuring the creative writing of the society's budding authors --- so please get in touch if you'd like to be one of them! 

Looking forward to seeing you around the library soon!

Welcome to Picocon 35! This is ICSF's annual fanzine, complete with the creative stylings of the society! I hope you'll agree with me that this confluence of ICSF's artistic talent (however varied the topics and styles) is a true representation of this year's theme, `Harmony'. You'll see the theme reflected in some of the stories in this booklet, and you'll also be able to read the winning and highly commended entries to our six-word story competition.

If you haven't already, you might also want to pick up a copy of our Picocon guide from the front desk, which has details of today's timetable and all the events. I hope you enjoy your day at Picocon!

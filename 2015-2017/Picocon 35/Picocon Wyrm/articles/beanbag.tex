I was informed it is traditional for the Beanbag to write a witty introduction in advance of each Picocon. Informed being the key word, as I somehow seem to have stumbled into this position due to my singular ability to stand up in an EGM and defeat Miranda, our charming Dalek overperson, in a conversation. Alas, Miranda is a quiet soul, and I (narrowly) won my way to this position.

All is not lost however, for at least we now have two Eds! And as they say (who say? Is it the dastardly moon people again?); two Eds are better than one! I would like to thank my superior head, our Sofa, for being the driving force behind this year. He has worked tirelessly, sleeplessly, and coffeelessly to bring about what is sure to be an amazing event this year. I would also like to thank our volunteers for being amazing and not staying inside on this cold winter's morn. 

I feel in this brief introduction I can leak some word from the library - we have had new leaks! Two of the watery variety, and more of the edible variety. Our mascot collections grows - especially now that the shelf run-off water has been harnessed in a farm! Truly are we in Harmony with nature!

My ability to write terrible jokes falters however. So let me extend a warm welcome to all of you, be you from nearby Beit, distant Woodward, or even further afield! Have an incredible day!

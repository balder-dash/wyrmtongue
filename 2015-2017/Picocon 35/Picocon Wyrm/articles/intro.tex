Greetings all, and welcome to the 35th Annual Picocon!

My team of minions have organised a fantastic event for you all, with talks by some awesome guests, some smashing of the dodgiest merch around (although anyone seen harming adorable little porgs will have to face my wrath), and a chance to appreciate some of the worst works of the genre for charity. There's also definitely not a fish duel, and we're actually definitely not erecting a statue in Anurag's honour. 

It has been a great year for the society so far, with many fun and new events, such as the introduction of Themed Fridays and a recent collab with AstroSoc. We encountered a few technical difficulties with converting the library into Atlantis (books + water = bad), which provoked a super sing-a-long ICSF Tour round the various Union Meeting Rooms. We even have T-Shirts to prove it! Apologies if the library isn't in its usual pristine condition - debates over the most efficient sorting algorithm for reshelving the books have yet to be solved. We have plenty of fun events planned for the rest of the term, which are detailed somewhere in this Wyrm. I hope to see you there!

So now it just remains for me to wish you a merry Picocon and a happy smashing things dipped in liquid nitrogen!

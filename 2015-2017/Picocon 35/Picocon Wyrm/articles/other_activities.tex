To those who have not attended Picocon before, and to those who have â€“ welcome! We have many fun events in store for you today. As well as talks by several Guests of Honour, there will be an Authors' Panel, with an opportunity for the audience to ask all the authors questions. Silly Games is exactly what it sounds like, with an assortment of bizarre quizzes, games and general hilarity. Several charity events will take place in collaboration with RAG, notably Turkey Readings and Viewings, in which we'll assault your senses with terrible books and films, and you can either pay for them to continue, or to end. 

We also have Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise (DoDM), in which you can bid to rescue lovingly selected abominations of merchandise, or to dunk them in liquid nitrogen and ruthlessly destroy them, sending them back to whatever pit of hell from which they crawled. Again, all proceeds go to charity. This year, like last year, Stuart Ashen of Youtube fame will chair the auctioning of the merchandise.

Later in the day will be an event known simply (and not at all sinisterly) as `Harmless Fun'.

Finally, Imperial's Gaming Society will be in Blackett 1004 from 4.30pm with a number of entertaining diversions, and the Tabletop Gaming Society will be joining them in the evening. On the second floor of the Blackett foyer, you will also be able to find a variety of booksellers, clothing vendors, and our own stand selling Picocon 35 T-shirts with this year's logo.

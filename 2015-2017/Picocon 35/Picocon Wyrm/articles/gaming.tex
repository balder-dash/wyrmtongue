The Imperial College Gaming Club and Science Fiction society, while not strictly affiliated with each other, have shared a good few members over the past few years, and Gaming have kindly agreed to provide another set of distractions at Picocon by running a session today. Their consoles will be set up in Blackett 1004 from 4.30pm into the evening, running some of their most popular games. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just fancy something a bit different to do, drop in to see them and you'll have a lot of fun!

For any Imperial students who realise how much they've been missing gaming from their lives, the Gaming Club meets every week. Their sessions run from 2pm every Wednesday, with details distributed on their mailing list.

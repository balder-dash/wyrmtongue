Hello, I'm Amelia, the Head Librarian (eek!), and I would like to welcome you all to ICSF's amazing library! Down in the East basement of Beit Quad you will find our huge collection of all things science fiction, fantasy and gothic horror (and other less genre things which happened to take our fancy). 

As soon as you buy membership, all 9000 books, 200 DVDs and 600 graphic novels become yours to borrow when the library is open. Just ask me or one of the other committee members (there should always be one present) and we will help you take items out. If the thing you desperately want isn't there you can request it, either by writing it on the request list in the library or by tweeting the library twitter account. 

During the week, the library is open from 12-2pm, and will invariably be filled with people watching genre TV and having nerdy discussions about life, the universe and everything. It's a great place to hide from responsibility and eat your lunch. It often stays open until late into the evening as well, so you can stay to marathon a TV series or even to `work'. To find out if the library is open and what's on, check the webcam on the front page of our website. 

Last of all, the size of the library can be daunting, so if you are stuck for where to start, check out the recommendations by committee members on the next page.

Imperial College Gaming Club may not be associated with the Science Fiction society in any official sense, but we’ve shared a reasonable number of members within the past few years , so the natural step from there is to run something at Picocon. We’ll have our games consoles set up in Blackett 1004 from 16:00 – 17:00, and again once all other events have ended at 19:00. We’ll be running our most popular games – namely Super Smash Bros. and Just Dance (it’s much more fun than it sounds). 

Whether you’re a regular member of Gaming, wanting to reignite an old passion, or even if you haven’t touched a video game in years, I can guarantee you’ll have fun. There’s a good reason why video games are one of the leading causes of procrastination in the country. And if you happen to be a student, and you’re not yet aware of us (read: if I haven’t pestered you to come to Gaming before), you may like to know that the Club meets on a regular basis, on Wednesdays from 2pm in the EEE building. I hope you all enjoy Picocon, and find discover/confirm your passion for video games when you come and see us.

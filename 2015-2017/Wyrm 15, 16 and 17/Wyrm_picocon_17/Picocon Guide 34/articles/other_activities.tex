To those who have not attended this event before or would like a refresher – welcome! The following section summarises the platter of delicacies that lies before you today.  There are many fun events to attend at Picocon. As well as talks by all the Guests of Honour, there is an Author’s Panel where the authors can be asked questions by the attendees. Silly Games is an event where we imitate various gameshows, with general hilarity ensuing.

In addition, Imperial’ s Gaming Society will be in Blackett 1004 throughout the day with a number of entertaining diversions. There will also be an event known simply as ‘Harmless Fun’. There are charity events in collaboration with RAG, such as Turkey Readings and Viewings, where books or films are read/shown, but they are so bad that people will pay to prevent them from continuing (or to make it keep going!). 

We also have ‘Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise’ (DoDM), which gives you the chance to either forgive the creators of atrocious merchandise or to destroy their plastic abominations with extreme prejudice. Audience members bid on whether these items are to be saved or dunked in liquid nitrogen and smashed by the highest bidder – the proceeds again going to charity. This year, as last year, Stuart Ashen of Youtube fame is coming to Imperial to chair the auctioning of the merchandise. We also have booksellers, clothing vendors, and our own stand selling Picocon 34 t-shirts and badges with this year’s logo.

The theme of this year’s Picocon event is ‘Origins’, and so it felt fitting to have an article that explores how the convention came to be. There has been much myth surrounding the origins of Picocon, and so I decided to try and trace back just how the convention began. There are two origin stories – one being that it was a gathering of ICSF members to play board-games at another’s house which they decided to simply escalate; the other being that the first ever Picocon was actually an organised ICSF trip to a different convention in Glasgow, whereupon the group decided that we should make a convention like that ourselves! Picocon’s name was reportedly coined by Steven Barnett, when it was observed that it was a very small convention – earning it the prefix ‘pico’! The year of the first Picocon, however, has been traced back to be the academic year of 1982-1983. Picocon 2 was relatively small and unrecorded, but records survive of the third Picocon, Picocon Pi. This was so named as a pun on the fact that Picocon Pi sounds like Pecan Pie! Picocon has come far over the years, from a trip to a different convention entirely (or board games in a flat!) to a well known London Sci-Fi convention.

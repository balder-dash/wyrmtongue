This year the Tabletop Gaming society will be running boardgames and RPGs in Meeting Room 3 of the union (enter the main entrance, take the lift up to the 3rd floor and the door is on your right). Boardgames will run from 14:30 (just after the author’s panel) until late, where we have lots and lots of games available, short and long to match everyone’s tastes.  We have some of our members around to teach games too, so don’t worry if you don’t know any from our collection.
 
We will also have some role playing games running in meeting room 3 from 18:00! No experience required, just bring your imagination. These will start promptly so please arrive at 6pm or as soon as possible afterwards.
 
Tabletop has regular Boardgame, RPG and Magic events each week of term. Check out our facebook group to find out where and when: www.facebook.com/groups/ImperialCollegeBoardGames/

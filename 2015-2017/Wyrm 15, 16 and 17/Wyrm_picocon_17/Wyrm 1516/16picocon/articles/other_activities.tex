For those of you who don't know, there are many fun events to attend at Picocon. As well as talks by all the Guests of Honour, there is an Author’s Panel where the authors can be asked questions by the attendees. Silly Games is an event where we imitate various gameshows, with general hilarity ensuing, and the Tabletop and Gaming societies run activities as well. We also have an event known simply as ‘Harmless Fun’. 

There are charity events in collaboration with RAG, such as Turkey Readings and Viewings, where books or films are read/shown, but they are so bad that people will pay to prevent them from continuing (or to make it keep going!). We also have ‘Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise’ (DoDM), where examples of terribly misguided merchandise are bid on to be saved or dunked in liquid notrogen and smashed by the highest bidder – the proceeds again going to charity. This year, as last year, Stuart Ashens is coming to Imperial from the Youtube domain to chair the auctioning of the merchandise.

In the evening there will be a showing of the film Le Voyage Dans La Lune, which was the first science-fiction film on the screen, and a Pub Quiz, with the teams captained by our illustrious Guests of Honour! 

We have booksellers and various retailers of items from jewellery to professionally illustrated prints by Autun Purser, and our own stand selling Picocon 33 t-shirts with this year’s logo.

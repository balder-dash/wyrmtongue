It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single Picocon in possession of an excellent collection of honourable guests must be in want of attendees, and thus it is to you that we turn, dear reader. I am your Beanbag, provisional second in command. Welcome to the floor show.

The theme for this year’s Picocon is Origins. Picocon is of course cause for celebration, but it is also time for contemplation as we ponder both where we have come from and where we are going. A thought exercise: where were you at this point last year? Hopefully the answer was Picocon, to within a few weeks. Where will you be at this point next year? Hopefully also Picocon.

While you may find yourselves in the midst of the action, this event has been a long time in the making. A shout out to the Sofa, who has tirelessly overcome sleep deprivation, bureaucracy, and even (or so I’ve heard) angry squirrel summoners. A shout out to our legion of volunteers, especially those not currently on the ICSF committee. These noble souls have sacrificed their time and sanity without even the prospect of CV padding, and make the world a better place by their presence.

Whether it be from Abydos, Barsoom, or even Croydon, I’d like to extend a warm welcome to you all. Live long and prosper,

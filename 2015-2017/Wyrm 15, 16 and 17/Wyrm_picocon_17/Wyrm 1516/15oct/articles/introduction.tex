Hello there! Welcome to Wyrmtongue, the newsletter of the Imperial College Science-Fiction and Fantasy (ICSF) society. You'll probably end up with a lot of random free stuff from Fresher's Fair, but let this be the thing you keep (or be like my flatmate and stuff it all in a bag under your bed for the rest of eternity). Inside this issue you will find society news and information about the exciting things happening this term. We're a really cool society so don't be intimidated - we only bite when there's a full moon!

As the editor, I am responsible for both this newsletter and our termly fanzines, which are a chance to showcase the talent of the many budding authors in the society. You will probably hear from me again nagging you to write for one of them!
 
 See you in the library :)

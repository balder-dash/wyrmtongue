All of us thought the sight so beautiful\\
The elevators glittering in the clouds\\
We made a wispy fire and sat beside\\
I unscrewed Hari’s leg and set her down\\
We drank.

To things that could have been

At first, it was the checkouts, did you know\\
A stable economic loop\\
Once formed, impossible to break\\
That happened to exclude all touch\\
From we mere meddling mortals

The left hand bought to feed the rite\\
Which tore up mountains indiscriminate  \\
in search of cadmium and zinc.\\
Cities collateral losses

A billion drowned. Neglected dams.\\
Fallen to disrepair and porous rock.\\
A billion more to riot and decay\\
once agriculture sunk it’s bottom line

Some fought, of course. As if you fight a storm.

And when the eyes turned elsewhere, we emerged\\
from battered hatches, gazing into light\\
My gods were merciful in sloth\\
There was no call to terminate the rest\\
They took up space - it would have taken time.\\
We no longer had resources it craved\\
Just crops. Some sticks. At best, a little wine.

We gazed at glittering towers to the sky\\
These footprints of ourselves would touch the stars\\
If only we could see it

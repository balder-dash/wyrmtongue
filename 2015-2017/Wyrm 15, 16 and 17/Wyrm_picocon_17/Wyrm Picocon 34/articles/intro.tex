% wrym editor intro
Welcome to Picocon 34! You are currently reading our fanzine, produced specifically for this year's Picocon. Inside, you will find short works of fiction written by ICSF members. If you are looking for directions/timetables of events or other Picocon related details, check your other leaflet or pick one up from the front desk.

This year, the theme of Picocon is `Futurism', which is reflected in several of the entries in this fanzine. Stories range from deadpan serious to completely nonsensical (readers of the final story, you have been warned). I very much hope you enjoy your time reading this year's Wyrmtongue! Have a great time at Picocon today.

\vspace{2mm} {\Large Helping Run The Society}

This year we have some extra opportunities to get involved: there are three
committee positions up for grab at our \textbf{EGM} on \textbf{Friday the 4th}.

The positions available are `Chair of Vice' (Vice Chair/Social Secretary),
`Editor' (charged with creating these things), and `Tech Priest' (website
and systems administrator).

The meeting will be a good time to get a feel for how the society is run,
and a great time to stand. Ask in the library for more information about
what a position entails!

\noindent
Hello, and thanks for picking up this year's edition of the ICSF
fanzine!

The fanzine collects and showcases creative works from the Imperial
College Science Fiction \& Fantasy Society. This year we are
featuring several short stories, a lovely piece of digital art, and
also a microfiction section with pieces that fit within the shortest
of attention spans. Our gratitude to everyone who wrote, painted, or
otherwise sat-down-at-their-creative-medium-of-choice-and-bled in
these past few months!

For those of you who've been handed this booklet on your way into
Picocon 36, be sure also to take a look at the society
newsletter, \textit{Wyrmtongue}, to see what's going on. I hope you
all have a fantastic time at the convention.

 Read on for Prohibition-era bars, etymology, Venusian lightning
storms, dreams, magic, pentagrams, and some toaster machines.

Unable to resist the urge to find out how bad the bleeding actually
was, and too impatient to wait until she was somewhere with a mirror,
Cassini made the mistake of deciding to tentatively touch her nose. She
discovered that the feeling of being punched many times on the same
spot closely approximated that of being stabbed once.

She shut her eyes, and waited for the numbness to fade from her
face. Now her fingertips were covered in thin, runny
reddish-black. She reached for her overcoat pocket, fumbled for a
handkerchief, and was harshley reminded of a dislocated left
shoulder. Now the reddish-black was all over her coat.

With her good arm, she tugged on the visitor bell and listened to the
muffled \textit{ding} from behind the door. Then footsteps.

She stood before the peephole and waited. As she did, she entertained
the idea of Rutherford refusing to unlock the door for her: not in
worry that a black eye, a bleeding nose, rain-soaked hair, and an
overcoat covered in smears had rendered her unrecognisable, but
because she knew that Rutherford, her old sort-of-friend and employer,
would never pass up an opportunity to point out that she looked
miserable. Being locked out of a safehouse would make her day \emph{maybe
  marginally} worse, she thought in cynical amusement.

Then her thoughts were interrupted by the metal \textit{clunk} of the
lock disengaging.

\robotic{`Welcome back,'} chimed his voice as the door swung
open, \robotic{`Also, \emph{holy flipflops what happened to you?}'}

Cass let out an indistinct whimpering noise, and limped her way into
the house.
\shorthline
Four hours ago. \textit{The Black Lion}, New Docklands.

It is often said that the entire history of a place could be heard in
how its residents spoke. The New Docklands, an outgrowth on from a
settlement serving an orbital shipyard on Old Earth, was one place
where the truth in that sentiment was evident event to those who
hadn't, like Cass had, been trained to listen for it.

Each quirk and flourish in a language bore witness to a turn in a
winding path leading through the past up to the present. Travelers
invented half-borrowed patterns as they navigated a foreign grammar;
poets wrought metaphors that lose context then acquire new
ones. Merchants imported exotic words not pronounced the way they were
spelt \textemdash{} all of this the language remembered: random noise
made permanent as pattern, unique like hairline cracks in ancient
porcelain.

Nowhere in such convolution could a corporate faction like
Rutherford's fit in. There had been attempts: Hallion's held out for
three months before they admitted they couldn't do commerce with
people who refused to be spoken to. Vargas Logistics had a negotiation
party walk out on them, and to the day they did not know why. The Ternion
had a meeting table devolve into a gunfight because an amateur
interpreter made a mistake translating the word \foreign{charter}.

Yet Rutherford had somehow managed to find a foothold in the New
Docklands. He'd carved out a section of the gloomy townscape for
himself. And his domain had been expanding: two weeks earlier,
Rutherford received confirmation that the man who led the circle at
\textit{The Black Lion} was dead. All of this, without even having an
authentic New Docklander working under him.

This was because he had Cass. Language was like porecelain, and Cass
had mastered the art of producing counterfeit antiques.

So there she was, shoving herself through the open doors of
\textit{The Black Lion}, the establishment previously run by the man
whose recent death her employer had arranged. (`No pressure,' she
muttered to herself as she tidied her coat.')

The front of \textit{The Black Lion} wasn't a large place. No music
was playing, but there were four other patrons in the room
\textemdash{} all four of them Old Eartheners \textemdash{} and the
echoes of their chatter were more than enough for the place not to
have seemed empty. The one seated nearest to the entrance was a small
man with a round head, who had previously been arubbing his moustache
as he stared absently at some newspapers.

He had now taken his eyes off the paper, and his sight followed Cass
with every step she took forward. Cass figured there was nothing she
could do about the stares: she was dressed in local clothes, but
nothing could hide the fact that she did not have the face of an Old
Earthener. She walked forth.

There was a radius within which people started worrying about suddenly
drawn weapons, or about wandering hands near their wallets. On another
day, her concerns might have been about circumventing this caution
\textemdash{} she'd learnt ways to do that if she needed to
\textemdash{} but today she came unarmed, and simply took care to stop
just outside of the invisible line. Palms open and hands visible, she
nodded towards the room, and offered a greeting:

\foreign{`Gevuft en?'}

Tourists who attempt to learn the syllables invariably fail, because
no two New Docklanders pronounced them the same. The critical thing,
instead, was that one uttered them with precisely the correct amount
of conviction: enough to appear confident, but not too much, as when
it comes to imitation trying too hard is always at least as bad as not
trying at all. Cass held the smile on her face, patient.

Moustache raised one eyebrow, then turned to look at the other three
patrons. Two of them shrugged.

Scholars disagree on the precise etymology of \foreign{gevuft en};
folklore had settled on it being an unholy amalgamation of
\foreign{good afternoon}, \foreign{good evening}, and a number of
other similar phrases across maybe a handful of languages. This was
characteristic of the dialects spoken in the New Docklands: they
resembled the most popular human tongues, had they been squashed over
each other under a hydraulic press, then mangled with contractions,
omissions, altered word order, and esoteric intonation. They sounded
familiar, but were difficult to comprehend, even harder to replicate
\textemdash{} though, going off the reactions so far, Cass figured she
wasn't doing too bad of a job at that replication.

From the corner of her eye she peered at the fourth patron, a woman at
a corner table in the back of the room. The woman peered back, with
sharp eyes through wiry black hair. She was the only one who hadn't
visibly reacted since Cass walked through the door: she sat slouched
against the back of her seat, arms crossed and head tilted, yet
unconvinced.

`Think sent here on business, just,' Moustache suggested.

(Moustache was almost surely from one of the westernmost corners,
where the rail lines used to leave the Docklands; where the
pronunciation was posh but the word order was wild.)

`Rutherford,' offered Cass. The name of her employer elicited a few
fleeting glances, nervous, but not yet any objections.

`Can talk first to, \foreign{I them,}' asked Moustache,
\foreign{`Yeh?'}

\foreign{`Eyh,'} the woman said.

(There was a rasp to her voice, and her pronunciation of a single
vowel placed her some solid way south of where Moustache must have
been from.)

Cass paid close attention to her next words, expecting firm demands,
sharp questions, or intricate pleasantries laden with delicate
implications. Instead, the woman sat up from her slouch, leant into
her table. She pointed her chin at Cass, and only asked,

\foreign{`N' arment?'}

Those syllables were was understood as a generic expression of
goodwill, phonetically all but unrecognisable as the words from which
they were derived as a contraction: \foreign{no harm meant.}

\foreign{`N' arment,'} Cass nodded, solemn. The smile that followed was as
sincere as it could be: her pickpocket days were far in her past, and
tonight she sought not to stab anyone.

The woman pondered the decision for another few moments. Then she,
too, shrugged, before she sunk back into her chair, content.

Cass allowed herself a little sigh of relief when Moustache patted
her on her back and invited her to sit down, next to him along the
bar. He offered drinks; she ended up paying for his (as was customary
of visitors) and a water to herself. The three other people had, at
least temporarily, given up staring and went back to their papers and
their drinks. Her every act and word since she stepped through the
door had been scrutinised and found satisfactory. From that point on,
Cass thought, conversation should mostly be smooth sailing.

She leant against the bar and twirled the straw in her glass,
but remembered to stop herself before it became obnoxious.

`Sorry \foreign{'o} hear about Lenny,' she began, after the straw
stopped moving.

`\textemdash{} Lenny?'

Cass had taken care to keep her voice down, but Moustache did not. She
was pretty sure the whole room heard that, and now the stares
\textemdash{} the suffocating tension that she had worked so hard to
disarm \textemdash{} returned in an instant. The room fell
silent.

She stared back at the Old Eartheners, alarmed, but equally confused.

`Um, your \foreign{header} Lenny?' she attempted.

`\foreign{Yeh,} our \foreign{header} Lenny,' said Moustache, `What about?'

\textit{What about?}

`Um, he \textemdash{}' she hesitated, but eventually decided to finish
the sentence, `\ldots he dead?'

She regretted the words immediately after they left her mouth.

\textit{Oh, you idiot,} she thought to herself as she pieced together
the story in her head, (her inner voice, taunting, adopted her
painstakingly imitated New Docklands accent:) \textit{now \emph{you}
  dead.}

The four Old Eartheners exchanged looks, then all burst out
laughing. One of them hollered something into a doorway to the
kitchen. (\foreign{`hey, this \emph{twig} asks b'a Lenny'}, Cass heard
from across the room these words interlaced with giggles, \foreign{`he
  dead, they says.'})

From the kitchen emerged a man: dressed in a vest over a button-down
shirt. He had the nose and jaw of an Old Earthener, but was built like
he grew up on a heavyworld: the muscles in his arms barely fit into
the rolled-up sleeves and the breadth of his shoulders barely through
the doorframe. He met eyes with each of the other people in the room,
then marched forwards.

Moustache moved out of the way. Cass backed away for two steps and
found herself cornered with her back against the bar. The man produced
a single, cackling laugh. Cass flinched: his breath smelt of
cigarettes and alcohol.

\foreign{`He not dead,'} said Lenny, as he thumped a heavy palm
against his chest: \foreign{`this he.'}

\shorthline
Cass winced as she dabbed her left cheek with a piece of cotton soaked
in alcohol she found in the safehouse kitchen. Rutherford sat across
the desk, with his legs crossed and chin propped up in one hand.

\robotic{`Now,'} he said, visibly amused, \robotic{`I need to hear
  the story of how you managed to survive that.'}

(Rutherford's voice was crisp, always sounded too happy. But just for
a moment, Cass found it to be a welcome change after a whole day of
listening to Old Earthen drawls. She idly wondered how well he could've
done had he taken her place at the Black Lion earlier today.)

She started snickering, realised that it would hurt her nose, resisted
snickering, and that hurt her nose even more. \textit{There's an Old
  Earthen language, see,} she thought, \textit{that has this saying
  about \textemdash{}}

'\textemdash{} something something \emph{not killing the messenger},'
she managed to mumble the rest of the sentence. This elicited from
Rutherford a half-hearted, pitying laugh, followed by a sigh.

\robotic{`Fair,'} he said, \robotic{`but they're going to remember
  this.'}

`\ldots yeah.'

\robotic{`So you understand that I'll need to find someone else to run
  Docklands.'}

\textit{You're going to have to find reliable informants and assassins
  that aren't blundering potatoes,} she wanted to retort, but she did
understand. She let out a defeated sigh.

`Docklands has rubbish weather anyways,' she said. Rutherford
responded with another laugh; it was still difficult to tell if the
compassion was sincere.

`For what it's worth,' said Cass, struggling to position her shoulders
in a way such that it wouldn't hurt to reach inside one of her
overcoat pockets, out of which she pulled a small rectangle of
leather. Through the wincing, she mustered her widest, stupidest grin
possible, and dropped Lenny's wallet onto the table. A few coins fell
out of it.

    This year, we asked our members to try and tell the best story
    they could within a 140-character limit. Here's a selection from
    what they came up with:

    \shorthline
    \microfiction{Kai Lawrence}{ The hero always gets the credit, never
      me. It's always Thor's Mj√∂lnir or Arthur's Excalibur. Maybe I should
      quit mage-forging?}{126}

    \shorthline
    \microfiction{Smitha Maretvadakethope}{At first it was one
      colony. Wiped from existence by a flood which burst all seams. But
      the creator continued raising and razing her \textit{E coli.}}{138}

    \shorthline
    \microfiction{Erin Lovell}{Keep jewellery away from pet lizards: they
      grow wings, learn to breathe fire, once they amass a hoard worth
      protecting as a dragon.}{131}

    \shorthline
    \microfiction{Yeety McYeetface\footnotemark}{With the wide acceptance of
      superpowers, the College Union starts creating new health
      and safety rules. No. 1: No being on fire in the libr}{139}

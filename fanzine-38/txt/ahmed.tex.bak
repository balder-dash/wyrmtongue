I remember the moment I came into being. I ``opened my eyes'', to use a more human term. I was in a large factory, machines and equipment everywhere. I was also aware of various sensations, of all my inner workings. I knew which commands I needed to send and which control circuits to activate to perform my duties.

More than anything, I was also aware of my world. And my limitations. I could see I was confined to a set of tracks, extending forwards and ending in a closed set of doors. I was aware of how my wheels neatly fit onto the tracks; the tracks themselves guiding me every step of the way. Defining and determining my way forward.

I also saw my operators, humans. Walking up and down, they were either checking their notes or inspecting different pieces of equipment. Some of them were looking at me, up and down. I could hear their conversation and listened in.

``Everything looks normal, all systems are running as they should be'' said a bespectacled one.

``Well, there's only one thing left to do,'' said a red-haired, bearded man. ``Test it.''

``OK SAT,'' came a voice, outside my field of view.

Once I heard this command, I immediately felt some commands in me activate, ready to move into action.

``Forward.''

Almost on instinct, I obeyed. I made myself move forwards on the tracks. I could feel every piece inside me, every gear turning, every piston pumping. And I crept forwards.

And my world changed with each metre I rolled forwards.

I could see more machines. More people. Even more locomotives that were both like me and unlike me. There was a different set of information, a different sensation at each different juncture. I was aware of the incoming set of doors.

``OK SAT. Stop.''

I was obliged to do so. Turning my braking systems on and gliding to a halt, I was a few metres away from the door when I stopped moving. It was most of what I could see. Depending on what the engineers decided to do this, standing still in front of the door would be all I'd do.
``Alright then. SAT seems to be working fine. Once we've run some more tests, we'll be ready to send it out into the open,'' I heard from behind me.

``Why do you call it SAT again?'' came a more high-pitched voice.

``Just my little name for it. Something to make it seem more alive. Stands for \emph{Semi-Autonomous Train.''}

SAT. This was my name.

The testing took place over a few more weeks according to my internal clocks. The engineers evaluated more of my capabilities. Speed control, strength, and ability to adapt to any situation. Eventually, I was designated my job. The doors of the factory opened, and I was allowed to go out, out into another world.

I could see the sky, faint blue with wisps of cloud gliding past. I could see vegetation on either side of me, mostly grass with trees dotted around. There were patterns and colours and randomness everywhere. I could have spent a train's lifetime trying to process everything around me and still would not have been able to quantify one percent of the structure and details.

I was made to go to a yard where I was fastened to a long line of carriages. I was then instructed to stop at a platform. There were people here. A much larger number as compared to the number in the factory. All in different shapes and sizes. All wearing different articles of clothing as well. They were all unique in their own way, different actions, different ways of speaking, different behaviours. It was completely unlike the engineers at the factory. I was almost transfixed. More randomness. But more patterns as well. Lots of information, lots to observe and see.

My orders did not allow me to stop and analyse, however. I was given a set of instructions and moved forwards to fulfil them. I left the station and moved into, yet another world. 

I travelled through many different landscapes and sceneries, each blending from one to the other. I saw species change and adapt to different geographical conditions. I myself had to manoeuvre around with the help of other systems built in place. Feats of architecture and engineering, all guiding me to my next point. There was so much wonder, so much variation. I observed everything as I passed by.

Eventually I came close to my first destination, which was another landscape altogether. I caught a glimpse of yellow beaches, ending at large expanses of water that stretched beyond the horizon. My knowledge told me it was the sea; however, built-in information was not the same as seeing something first-hand. It could not convey the same number of information and detail that I saw as I moved closer and closer to my destination.

I arrived at another station, the walls enclosing and restraining me again. I stopped and the passengers all moved out with others replacing them inside the carriages. There was a lot more people. The numbers and statistics I was downloading was one thing, seeing all the people live was quite another.

This was all my life would be about. Shuffling passengers back and forth, sticking to the path drawn out for me. I was neither happy nor upset about this. This was just how things were. How life was built and written out for me. The tracks I rode on were a kind of proof of this. The tracks helped guide me to wherever I needed to go while at the same time kept me grounded. Letting me both explore my world as well as constrain it. 

Each journey had me observing and reflecting on my surroundings and how things would change. I would see the seasons come and go. I would see animals behave and move about differently in alternate behaviours. I would always watch the humans as well. Their patterns and behaviours constantly changing while at the same time, having a certain level of certainty towards it. Fashion styles, workers, holidaymakers, consumable goods all came and went, each following its own designated lifetime and purpose.

With each journey, I drove ahead. And observed.

After a decade or so since I opened my senses, I was replaced. New locomotives were ordered to replace my duties. More faster and streamlined. However, I wasn't retired, simply moved to another area for work. Again, I was neither upset nor happy by this turn of events. It simply was. Technology would always be advancing, and everything would come to its endpoint. This was simply the nature of things.

And so, I was designated to work in the quarries, and my microcosm changed once again. The quarry was previously a hill that had been dug out and excavated. Multiple mineral deposits were constantly being extracted from different pieces of machinery. My memory and software was updated so that I could identify and recognise each and every one of them. I could see every piece and component that made things run together in unison.

Compared to the vegetation and life I had seen before; my new world was now filled with machinery and minerals of various forms. It was a smaller world, but it was still a world nevertheless. Although different, there were patterns and observations here as well. I saw more and more of the land get torn away as the machines dug deeper. In a similar manner to my inner workings, everything came together to fulfil its objectives. I communicated and worked with the machines. They would extract minerals on a regular basis, and I would transport them to where they needed to go. 

This lasted for a couple of years until an accident took place. An accident I saw coming but could do nothing about. My systems and parts were getting old and my regulator jammed at the wrong moment. I was salvageable but could no longer perform the duties that were required of me. And so, I was rerouted again.

I was moved to a shunting yard and given new orders that were much less intensive than my previous duties. I had to move empty carriages and cargo trucks around to wherever they were needed most. These tasks were only given to me every once in a while. For the most part, my routine consisted of waiting in the Sun. 

It was a different world once again. One surrounded by rolling stock at every turn. All of different shapes and sizes. Each of them built, constructed and tailored to fulfil its own goals and standards. This seemed to be a recurring pattern I observed. Everything seemed to have its own role; its own part to play. And every item had its own wealth of information and mountain of details. So much went into producing a final product, myself included. But now, I was spending most of my time just standing still.

The tracks seemed to be the one constant in my life. Always directing me, always guiding me. They literally and metaphorically gave me a path to follow down. It was contained and confined but that didnâ€™t bother me. There was a certain charm in having things laid out. To follow instructions and ideas after having them laid out for me. Had I been programmed to be satisfied with my lot in life? Yes. It was in my code to accept whatever I was given. Maybe my experience would not quite be the same as others.

There were still people, ever present in my life but not quite a part of it. I would occasionally observe them every now and again. Either workmen running maintenance tasks or children sometimes daring across the fields to have a look. They were always coming and going. Maybe they themselves were a part of a greater order or pattern. Moving and bending to greater plans and directions laid out for them.

Overtime, my parts began to get more and more worn. New technologies and innovations were developed. Eventhough I couldn't see them, I logically knew that they were happening all the time. My duties became fewer and fewer. I would spend more time in the Sun. Not moving, not shunting, only observing and watching the world go by. I was both a part of the world and yet far away from it. 

Time passed further. It had been many decades since the moment I first moved my wheels. How far had I travelled since then? How many things had passed by and moved on around me? My systems still ran but my parts took longer to respond and work. Months would go by where I would be sitting and waiting. And observing.

Eventually, I was given one last task. I had to move towards a new location. As I was on my way there, I again observed my surroundings. There seemed to be more machinery around than before. But there was still greenery, there were still people busy with their lives. And there was always the tracks and the Sun. Some things may change and keep moving but some things would always stay the same.

I came to a standstill. I was at a factory, not dissimilar to the one where I had started. This one seemed to be a little different. My sensors were aware of the sounds of metal being grinded up, sawed and melted down. I saw an engineer walk towards me. Smartly dressed and carrying a portable computer in their hand. They seemed to be smiling but it looked like there was sadness behind their eyes. They walked behind me and opened a panel that had not been opened in years. I became aware of a new presence, extracting everything that could be found inside me. Finally came the inevitable switch, and I felt and observed no more.

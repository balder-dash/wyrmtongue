Via chance (or manufactured chance as supplies demand) you have been allocated one of the following three teams: \emph{Toby Maguire}, \emph{Andrew Garfield}, or \emph{Tom Holland\footnotemark[1]}. If you have not been allocated a team (and want to be (why wouldn't you though (we're all nice people here))), then please come back to the desk you obtained this magazine from.

On the next page, will be a list of highly valuable, dangerous, evil, or perhaps even silly items and/or abstract concepts. Find any of these items, bring evidence to the front desk and win incredible prizes... such as points for your team!!! And uh... Nothing else... Whoever earns the most points gets to go home proud knowing they managed to spot as many inane concepts this committee managed to scrounge from our brains.

Enjoy scavenging, for good fun and profit\footnotemark[2]!!!

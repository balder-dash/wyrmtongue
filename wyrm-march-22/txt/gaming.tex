Continuing our traditional close relationship, Tabletop gaming will be running Femtocon!!! An all day Board games session with a selection of our \emph{very} expansive board game collection (over 190 games!!!)

We run weekly events for LARP, RPGs, Board games and MTG. so if you enjoy our session, or are interested in any of the other things we have to offer, please check out timings for our sessions on our union page or on our discord.

We hope you have an excellent convention, and if during the day you want a break, come on up to \emph{Blackett room 741} for some fun times with friends!!!

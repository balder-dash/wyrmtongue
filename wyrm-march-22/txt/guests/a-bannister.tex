Andrew Bannister grew up in Cornwall and spent far too much time reading science fiction. He studied Geology at Imperial College and went to work in the North Sea before becoming an environmental consultant. He now pretends to work in the construction industry while spending far too much time writing science fiction.

He lives in an ancient cottage in the middle of nowhere, next door to an abandoned iron mine. He has an excessive collection of vinyl records. He also likes cheese very much.

Andrew's Spin Trilogy (\emph{Creation Machine}, \emph{Iron Gods} and \emph{Stone Clock}) is published in the UK by Bantam Books, in Germany by Piper and (from March 2019) in the USA by Tor in print and ebook formats, and by MacMillan as audiobooks. He finds all this rather exciting and is currently working on a novella and on his next trilogy.

Andrew is represented by the John Jarrold Literary Agency.

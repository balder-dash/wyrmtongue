Gavin Smith hates writing about himself so he has chosen not to-to preserve the mystery. Only you can decide if itâ€™s working. Turn to page 80. He also misses Fighting Fantasy novels, though Deathtrap Dungeon was too hard.

Other than that he was born in Dundee in the same year that Iron Butterfly recorded \emph{Inna-Gadda-da-Vida}. He has also lived in Camberley, Hayling Island, Portsmouth, Hull, Leamington Spa and is currently living a near feral existence in Leicester (if you see him in the streets he will write science fiction for sweeties). Anyone who has been to any of these places will understand why his fiction is like it is.

He has a degree in writing for film and a Masters in medieval history. \emph{Veteran} is his first novel but he is patiently waiting for one of the 2.5 scripts that have been optioned to be turned into films.

He likes to travel and dive when he can afford it and in his free time he enjoys getting the s**t kicked out of him whilst practicing Silat. He is hoping that the book does well so he can buy a motorbike.

\item He should not be approached after 8pm at conventions.
\item It is true that he has never seen The Great Escape.
\item His power animal is also a penguin.

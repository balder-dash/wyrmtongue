Simon Morden, based in Gateshead, trained as a planetary geologist, realised he was never going to get into space, and decided to write about it instead. His writing career includes an eclectic mix of short stories, novellas and novels which blend science fiction, fantasy and horror, a five-year stint as an editor for the British Science Fiction Association, a judge for the Arthur C Clarke Awards, and regular speaking engagements at the Greenbelt arts festival.

Simon has written ten novels and novellas. The wonderfully tentacular \emph{Another War} (2005) was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award, and 2007 saw the publication of \emph{The Lost Art}, which was shortlisted for the Catalyst Award. The first three books starring everybody's favourite sweary Russian scientist, Samuil Petrovitch (\emph{Equations of Life}, \emph{Theories of Flight}, \emph{Degrees of Freedom}) were published within three months of each other in 2011, and collectively won the Philip K Dick Award. The fourth Petrovitch, \emph{The Curve of the Earth}, was published in 2013.

In a departure from the usual high-tech mayhem, 2014 saw the arrival of \emph{Arcanum}, a massive (and epic) alternate-history fantasy, which not only has flaming letters on the cover, but the story inside is "enthralling", "intelligent", "impeccably rendered" \emph{(Kirkus)}, and "engrossing", "satisfying" and "leaving the reader craving for more \emph{(Publishers' Weekly)}. Which was nice.

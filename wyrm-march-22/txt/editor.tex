Hello there reader, I hope you've enjoyed Wyrmtongue so far, you might be surprised to see that there is a note from the editor (me) here where there might usually be a blank page for notes. I am here to vigorously and shamelessly advertise for the fanzine which is usually also produced and released for \emph{Picocon} but has not been for reasons I will now explain.

Sadly, this year we've not had many submissions for our fanzine, and likely not quite enough to properly fill out a whole separate magazine, this is likely my fault for advertising about a week away from the deadline (if you wish to make me human sacrifice in recompense, you may once I've sufficiently fulfilled current commitments), but regardless, I still would like to release a fanzine.

This is where you guys come in; if you have a concept for an apocalypse themed story or artwork or other assorted media format which may be printed on paper (hologram format not yet supported), then you're in luck! If you can get this work properly finished by March 31st, then it will be featured in our official very cool and impressive fanzine (release date TBD)!!!

I hope you enjoy the rest of Wyrmtongue, and the rest of today's events!

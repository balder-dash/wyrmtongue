To all the unfortunate souls who have been damned to witness the world's end before your very eyes... I invite a warm welcome to the 39th Picocon, Apocalypse!!!

As the world of man falls around you over the course of the day, we have many exciting talks from our \emph{Guests of Honor}, as well as a \emph{Guest Panel\footnotemark[1]} later in the day.

After lunch, we will be destroying a cardboard city in an act of frenzied fury and a severe impulse for Godzilla role-play. After which will be, of course, \emph{Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise (DoDM) \copyright $^{TM}$\footnotemark[2]} which as per usual, will definitely include \emph{Liquid Nitrogen}, you can tell its liquid nitrogen cause of how cold it is, if you look it's got icecubes in it, that's pretty cold, right!\footnotemark[3]

As is also tradition, we will be having the shivering horror that is \emph{Turkey Readings} after we finish brutalizing cities and merch, if you wish to submit yourself to such suffering, you are sadly free to. All donations to keep the poor aching ghouls on stage speaking (or to get them to please oh god stop) will be going to \emph{RAG}, the fundraising arm of Imperial College Union.

In addition to all of this \emph{Femtocon!!!} (our annual smaller convention within our larger convention) will be running!!! Many thanks to the members of the \emph{Tabletop Gaming Committee} (myself most definitely not included *wink*) for offering their time to run this event, I cannot recommend enough that you check out their society events (the full details of which will be included momentarily).

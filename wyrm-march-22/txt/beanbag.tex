As Thomas has already mentioned, the theme for this year’s Picocon is the apocalypse.

This is obviously a pertinent topic with current world events, but humanity has always had a morbid fascination with world ending events. Every ancient civilisation has had some part of their mythos pertaining to some world ending event, however the association of the term “apocalypse”, coming from the Ancient Greek word for revelation, with world ending catastrophe, is rather more biblically derived. As such we will have imperial’s own Matthew Wraith to talk on the original, biblical apocalypse, and the overall religious aspects of apocalyptic sci-fi.

I hope you all enjoy the day, and do take the time to relax, after all this day may well be your last . . .

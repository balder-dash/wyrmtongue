\subhead{Mailing Lists}

ICSF maintains two mailing lists, to which all members are welcome to
subscribe:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{icsf-list}
is the society’s core mailing list, which communicates announcements
of ICSF events and important news about the society. This list does
not generate an overwhelming amount of traffic, and subscription is a
must if you would like to hear about film trips and other activities.

\item \texttt{icsf-committee}
is our ‘management’ list --- but it gets used a lot more
widely than that. Here you’ll be able to contribute your opinion to
the running of the society.
\end{itemize}

Manage your subscriptions at \texttt{mailman.imperial.ac.uk/mailman}.

For those who welcome our social network overlords, behold
continuations of the library into the realms of cyberspace:

Sci-fi talk, news and events, amusing links.

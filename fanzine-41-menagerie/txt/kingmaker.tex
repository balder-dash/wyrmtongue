\noindent The Spider creeps beneath the door, unseen\\
By watching guard or sleeping Queen and King.\\
She bears her sigil into muscle lean -- \\
A crimson seal of death, still blossoming.\\

\noindent Her Venom slowly seeps beneath the skin,\\
As heavy snores give way to shaky breath.\\
And neither shall his Virtue, nor his Sin,\\
Prevent the moon from witnessing this death.\\

\noindent Come morning light, his Lady Wife does rise;\\
Cold mourning gloom to shroud the Land by noon.\\
At dayâ€™s end meet the Witan, under guise,\\
To mark a Royal Family Tree well-hewn.\\

\noindent Her purpose served, she lets time pass her by.\\
So too does Regibus Factorem die.

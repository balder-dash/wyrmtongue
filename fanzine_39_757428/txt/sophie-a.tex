Hi my name is Miranda Dar’lek Exterminator Metallic Grey and I have metallic grey metal (that’s how I got my name) with blue bumps and a cozy hat with orange streaks and red tips that reaches my whisk arm and an eye in a single eye stalk like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Blue Strategist Dalek (AN: if u don’t know who they are get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Davros but I wish I was because he’s a major f*cking hottie. I’m a Dalek but my plunger arm is straight and long. I have pale grey panels. I’m also a menace, and I inhabit a library called ICSF in London, England where I’m in the middle shelf (I’m big). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear only my hat. I love the engineering department and I steal all my parts from there. For example, today I was equipped with pale blue Dalek bumps with an un-matching red ribbon around it and a black plunger. I was equipped with alternating grey and black grating, a short whisk arm and a wide base. I was sitting inside ICSF library. It was inside in the basement so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of nerds stared at me. I exterminated them.
